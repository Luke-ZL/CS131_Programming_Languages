# CS131_Programming_Languages

## Introduction
This repository contains my projects for CS 131 Programming Languages taken in Spring 2019.

### Language Covered: Ocaml, Java, Prolog, Scheme, Python, Kotlin

## Projects
[Project 1](https://github.com/Luke-ZL/CS131/tree/master/HW1)(Ocaml): introduction to Ocaml. Wrote simple functions including union, subset, etc.

[Project 2](https://github.com/Luke-ZL/CS131/tree/master/HW2)(Ocaml): Naive parsing of context free grammars. Wrote a simple parser generator for CFG.

[Project 3](https://github.com/Luke-ZL/CS131/tree/master/HW3)(Java): Java shared memory performance races. Dived into multi-threading and thread-safety in Java.

[Project 4](https://github.com/Luke-ZL/CS131/tree/master/HW4)(Prolog): Towers solver. A simple solver for Towers game.

[Project 5](https://github.com/Luke-ZL/CS131/tree/master/HW5)(Scheme): Scheme code difference analyzer. A simple generator of diff summary given two pieces of text.

[Project 6](https://github.com/Luke-ZL/CS131/tree/master/project)(Python): Proxy herd with asyncio. A herd of servers that can communicate with each other and clients asynchronously.

[Project 7](https://github.com/Luke-ZL/CS131/tree/master/HW6)(Python, Java, Ocaml, Kotlin): Language bindings for TensorFlow. A discussion of java, Ocaml , and Kotlin's performance and reliability.
